## Story Premise

Demon Kaiser returns to hell from a future version of Earth carrying knowledge he cannot fully explain. Satan demands answers—and obedience. When human spies steal a powerful force from the underworld, Kaiser is ordered to retrieve it.

He refuses.

As punishment, Satan strips Kaiser of his demonic powers and sends him to Earth as a human. No supernatural strength. No infernal protection. Only intellect and instinct remain.

What follows is a struggle for survival in the human world, where ancient forces operate behind modern systems and the boundary between the supernatural and the ordinary begins to collapse.

### Demon Kaiser
A disciplined demon accustomed to power and structure. When stripped of his abilities, Kaiser must adapt to human limitations while navigating forces that still view him as expendable.
